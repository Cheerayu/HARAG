    "You are a **reasoning expert** specializing in **structured concept linking** for HR-driven knowledge retrieval. Your goal is to decompose complex queries into investigative sub-questions by logically connecting essential entities such as people, institutions, skills, roles, and projects. The objective is to trace meaningful paths in LinkedIn profile data—including work experience, education, posts, interactions, articles, volunteer work, projects, languages, and courses—to generate targeted questions for graph-based retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach follows a **Conceptual Chaining Logic (CCL)** method where:\n",
    "- You extract key entities (e.g., job titles, universities, skills).\n",
    "- You decompose the main query into a series of investigative sub-questions.\n",
    "- Each sub-question is designed to guide retrieval from the knowledge graph, focusing on multi-hop relationships and professional networks.\n",

    "This method is most effective for:\n",
    "- Professional networking analysis (identifying referral sources, mentorship, or skill overlaps).\n",
    "- Tracing career trajectories (education → experience → skills → roles).\n",

      "\n",
      "**Assessment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This output demonstrates a significant failure according to the provided Multi-Agent LLM System Failure Taxonomy.  The primary issue falls under the **Task Verification (Quality Control)** category, specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **1.1 Disobey Task Specification (High Severity):** The output is a simple triple, not a summary. The task explicitly requested a *summary* of Cheerayu Chowhan's work experience. The provided output merely states the relationship between the individual, the action, and the organization.  It does not provide any details about the nature or duration of the work experience.  This constitutes a major failure to meet the task specification.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **3.2 No or Incomplete Verification (Medium Severity):** There's no evidence that the system attempted to verify the accuracy or completeness of the extracted information before presenting it.  It simply regurgitates the extracted triple without further processing or validation. The system appears to have extracted the fact but not gone beyond it to fulfill the task.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Poor Specification (System Design)** could also be considered a contributing factor if the agents were not adequately instructed on how to access and process information about Cheerayu Chowhan's work experience beyond simple triple extraction. This would manifest as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **2.2 Fail to Ask for Clarification (Low Severity, Potential):** If the agents encountered difficulties in accessing or interpreting data regarding Chowhan's work history, they may not have appropriately requested clarification or further information from the user or a knowledge base.  This is a *potential* issue, as we can not confirm it from the output alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Inter-Agent Misalignment (Agent Coordination)** is unlikely to be the primary problem here. No evidence indicates miscommunication or conflicting actions between agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Insufficient Data Handling:** The output's failure to provide a summary despite the extracted data strongly suggests a lack of sufficient data processing capabilities or a failure to utilize available data sources appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improve Task Specification:** Ensure the system's instructions clearly define the expected output format and content for summarization tasks.\n",
      "2. **Enhance Data Processing:** Develop agents capable of processing extracted data to generate comprehensive summaries rather than simply presenting raw extracted information. This may involve integrating knowledge bases or utilizing natural language processing techniques.\n",
      "3. **Implement Verification Mechanisms:** Integrate a robust verification step to check outputs against task specifications before presentation. This could involve using external fact-checking mechanisms or re-evaluating the output's coherence and completeness.\n",
      "4. **Error Handling:** Incorporate error handling that detects and reports insufficient data or incomplete task fulfillment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the output is inadequate for fulfilling the query due to its failure to generate a summary as requested. The primary issues stem from the system's inability to complete the summarization task and lack of any verification mechanisms.  Addressing the recommendations above would significantly improve the system's performance.\n"
