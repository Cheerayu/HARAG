        "About": "About Me: A Journey of Growth, Learning, and Giving Back: Welcome to my profile! I'm thrilled you're taking the time to get to know me. My story is a tapestry woven with threads of support from friends, mentors, family, nature, and my own determination. I'm grateful for every experience that has shaped me.\n1) Educational background: My journey began in an Army Public School, where I learned the invaluable lessons of discipline and consistency. These qualities paved my way to IIT Madras, where I spent four transformative years. I learnt the balance of life, horizontal and verticle expertise, importance of health, friendships and family. It changed me to still carry an inertia of growth and constant learning.\n2) Professional Experiences: Professionally, I'm at the helm of Schbang and SchbangQ as COO Tech, leading a dynamic team of 80 individuals. We're passionate about empowering businesses with delightful IT solutions, from mobile and desktop apps to SaaS products and websites. My role involves daily interactions with diverse stakeholders, from seasoned business leaders (for building the business) to fresh graduates (to hire the top talent-interviewed over 800+ candidates).\n3) Internships roller coaster: While I was a part of the team building Virtual Instruments (yes you could play Guitar, Drums, flute and other instruments in air) in my 2nd year, then I landed up at CERN, Switzerland to work on CMS. Working 30 metres underground with particle colliders was an insane experience. Coats India & ITC exposed me to the Indian style of hardwork and execution. The people there shaped me for better. Forever grateful to them.\n4) NGOs: Giving back to society and this universe is close to my heart. I've been actively involved with MAD chapters across Chennai, Hyderabad, and Mumbai for over three years, finding immense fulfillment in teaching underprivileged children. It's been incredibly rewarding to see some of these students secure full scholarships to study in Japan.\n5) Hobbies: Ever-evolving. I've learnt dancing through YouTube tutorials and find joy in writing poetry. Spirituality has been a seven-year journey, recently enriched by studying the Bhagavad Gita with industry leaders to gain insights on leadership and life. Through it all, my enduring passion for reading remains constant, serving as a faithful companion in my personal growth.\nThank you for your time and interest. I'm always open to engaging discussions, so feel free to reach out. Let's connect and explore new ideas together!",
